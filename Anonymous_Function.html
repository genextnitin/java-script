Anonymous Function

Anonymous Function is a function that does not have any name associated with it. Normally we use the function keyword before the function name to define a function in JavaScript, however, in anonymous functions in JavaScript, we use only the function keyword without the function name.
An anonymous function is not accessible after its initial creation, it can only be accessed by a variable it is stored in as a function as a value. An anonymous function can also have multiple arguments, but only one expression.


function() {
    // Function Body
 }
The below examples demonstrate anonymous functions.
Example 1: In this example, we define an anonymous function that prints a message to the console. The function is then stored in the greet variable. We can call the function by invoking greet().
