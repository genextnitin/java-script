JAVASCRIPT FUNCTIONS
JavaScript functions are used to perform operations. We can call JavaScript function many times to reuse the code.
Advantage of JavaScript function:
There are mainly two advantages of JavaScript functions.
•	Code reusability: We can call a function several times so it save coding.
•	Less coding: It makes our program compact. We don’t need to write many lines of code each time to perform a common task.
Syntax of declaring function :
function functionName([arg1, arg2, ...argN]){  
 //code to be executed  
}  
Example: 
-->
<html>
   <head>   
      <script type = "text/javascript">
         function sayHello() {
            document.write ("Hello there!");
         }
      </script>
      
   </head>
   
   <body>
      <p>Click the following button to call the function</p>      
      <form>
         <input type = "button" onclick = "sayHello()" value = "Say Genext">
      </form>
