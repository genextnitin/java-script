<!-- Variables
Variables are container for storing the data value.
A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location. 
There are some rules while declaring a JavaScript variable (also known as identifiers).
•	Name must start with a letter (a to z or A to Z), underscore( _ ), or dollar( $ ) sign.
•	After first letter we can use digits (0 to 9), for example value1.
•	JavaScript variables are case sensitive, for example x and X are different variables.
EXAMPLE: -->
<<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
	<title>  </title>
</head>
<body>

	 <script>
			var x = 10;  
			var  y = 20;  
			var z=x+y;  
			document.write(z);  
     </script>

</body>
