<!-- JavaScript provides different data types to hold different types of values. There are two types of data types in JavaScript.
•	Primitive data type
•	Non-primitive (reference) data type
JavaScript primitive data types
There are five types of primitive data types in JavaScript. They are as follows:
DATA TYPES	
String	Represent sequence of character.”genext”
Number		Represent value.100
Boolean	Represent value either true or false
Undefined	Represent undefined value
Null	Represent null;no value at all

JavaScript non-primitive data types:
The non-primitive data types are as follows:
DATA TYPES	
Object	Represent instance through which we can access  member.
Array	Represent group of similar values.
REGEXP	Represent regular expression.

JavaScript is a dynamic type language, means you don't need to specify type of the variable because it is dynamically used by JavaScript engine. You need to use var here to specify the data type. It can hold any type of values such as numbers, strings etc.
For example:
var a=40;    //holding number  	
var b="Rahul";      //holding string  
•	Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.
•	If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.
•	One Statement, Many Variables.
•	You can declare many variables in one statement.
•	“Start the statement with var and ‘separate’ the variables by comma and End by ; ”. -->
