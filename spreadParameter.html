<!-- 	Spread operator :- allows an iterable to expand in places where 0+ arguments are expected. It is mostly used in the variable array where there is more than 1 values are expected. It allows us the privilege to obtain a list of parameters from an array. Syntax of Spread operator is same as Rest parameter but it works completely opposite of it.
// normal array concat() method -->

<script> 
let arr = [1,2,3];
let arr2 = [4,5];

arr = arr.concat(arr2);

console.log(arr); // [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
